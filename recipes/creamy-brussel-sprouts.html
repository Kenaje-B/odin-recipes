    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 slices bacon, (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds Brussel sprouts, (trimmed and cut in half)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to season</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1.5 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ cup mozzarella, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook chopped bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until very crisp, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Turn off heat and transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter, then add olive oil and the Brussels sprouts. Season them with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and dried thyme right in the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook Brussels sprouts on medium high heat for 8-10 minutes to ensure browning of the sprouts. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan while cooking.</li>
        <li>Next pour in the heavy cream, reduce heat down to low and allow the sprouts to simmer until tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the bacon in and mix to combine all of the flavours together. Top the sprouts with the mozzarella cheese and increase the heat. <strong>The cheese will quickly melt on top of the warm sauce and will thicken it.</strong></li>
        <li>Simmer for additional 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with a little extra pepper and more mozzarella cheese before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>

    </ol>
