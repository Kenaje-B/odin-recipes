    <h3>Creamy Cajun Pasta</h3>
    <p>LARGE SHRIMP and SMOKED SAUSAGE. If there is one thing I can always count on my family to eat it is my Cajun food. We love this traditional Southern shrimp pasta recipe in our house! I always make it with LARGE SHRIMP and SMOKED SAUSAGE.</p>
    <p>ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE. By the way, I like to use Andouille sausage. Is it andouille’s french origin that gives it such a sharp and distinct flavor and odor? All I know is that we recently had some company over for dinner and this creamy sausage pasta became a huge hit!</p>
    <p>CAJUN SAUCE. Because the Cajun sauce is homemade, it is so much better than anything in a jar! And so incredibly simple! The cooking time for this creamy shrimp pasta recipe is only 40 minutes as it all comes together pretty quickly.</p>
