    <h2>Creamy Cajun Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage</h2>
    <p>LARGE SHRIMP and SMOKED SAUSAGE. If there is one thing I can always count on my family to eat it is my Cajun food. We love this traditional Southern shrimp pasta recipe in our house! I always make it with LARGE SHRIMP and SMOKED SAUSAGE.</p>
    <p>ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE. By the way, I like to use Andouille sausage. Is it andouille’s french origin that gives it such a sharp and distinct flavor and odor? All I know is that we recently had some company over for dinner and this creamy sausage pasta became a huge hit!</p>
    <p>CAJUN SAUCE. Because the Cajun sauce is homemade, it is so much better than anything in a jar! And so incredibly simple! The cooking time for this creamy shrimp pasta recipe is only 40 minutes as it all comes together pretty quickly.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. large shrimp, (peeled and deveined)</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon dried Oregano</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Olive oil</li>
        <li>6 oz andouille sausage or smoked sausage, (thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>10 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, (thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, (thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons Cajun seasoning, (or Creole seasoning)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic, (chopped)</li>
        <li>½ cup crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth, sodium free</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>⅔ cup Grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon parsley, (chopped)</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Toss shrimp with salt, pepper, Cajun seasoning and Oregano, and coat well. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and drizzle bottom of pan with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Add shrimp and cook for 2 minutes. Flip shrimp over and cook another minute or two. Then remove to a plate and set aside. Drizzle pan with a little more olive oil, add sausage and brown until nicely caramelized, about 4 – 5 minutes. Remove to plate, set aside.</li>
        <li>Add pasta to salted boiling water and cook until al dente.</li>
        <li>Lower heat to medium and add a bit more olive oil to the pan, add the onion, red bell pepper, Cajun seasoning, brown sugar, and a generous pinch of salt. Sauté until onion and pepper have softened a bit, scraping up any browned bits that you can. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add crushed tomatoes, chicken broth and heavy cream. Bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping up any brown bits from bottom of pan, simmer a couple minutes.</li>
        <li>Once simmering, add Parmesan and stir into sauce. When Parmesan is blended in, add cooked pasta and sausage and stir to combine and heat through, 2 – 3 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste and then lastly, add shrimp.</li>
        <li>Serve with chopped parsley.</li>
