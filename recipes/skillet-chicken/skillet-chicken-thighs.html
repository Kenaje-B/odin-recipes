<h2>Skillet Chicken Thighs in Mushroom Pan Sauce</h2>
<p>Skillet Chicken Thighs in Creamy Mushroom Pan Sauce are amazing in flavor and taste thanks to dry white wine and the juice of a fresh lemon. Creamy gourmet style pan sauce is silky smooth and yes, everything is made from scratch. Serve these chicken thighs over pasta, rice or pour the sauce over mashed potatoes!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul> <h4>Chicken:</h4>
    <li>6 chicken thighs, skinless and boneless</li>
    <li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<ul> <h4>Mushroom Sauce:</h4>
    <li>4 tablespoon butter, (divided)</li>
    <li>10 oz mushrooms, sliced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon flour, (wheat or rice)</li>
    <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>1 cup beef broth, sodium free</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme , (can also use Italian seasoning)</li>
    <li>fresh thyme leaves, for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol> <h4>Cooking Chicken:</h4>
        <li>Season both sides of chicken thighs with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of butter to hot skillet and melt over medium high heat. Add seasoned chicken thighs and cook on medium high heat for 4 minutes. Slightly reduce the heat and flip them over and cook for additional 4-5 minutes, for a total of 8-10 minutes. Remove from skillet.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol> <h4>Mushroom Sauce:</h4>
        <li>To the now empty skillet add 2 more tablespoons butter, sliced mushrooms and cook on medium heat until lightly browned, 4-5 minutes. Remove mushrooms from skillet onto the same plate with chicken.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat. To the once again empty skillet, slowly sift in 2 tablespoons flour and mix it with the fats in the pan with a whisk or fork. Cook flour for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next slowly pour ½ cup of wine. Make sure flour and wine are well incorporated and simmered for about 2 minutes to eliminate raw-flour taste and concentrate wine flavor.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat and add beef broth (beef broth will make sauce dark) and lemon juice (I squeezed the juice straight into the pan). Whisk or mix everything in together. </li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and add salt, pepper and onion & garlic powders. Sauce should be bubbling. Taste to see if more seasoning is required.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol> <h4>Putting it all together:</h4>
        <li>Add chicken and mushrooms back to the pan, spreading some mushrooms on top of the chicken. Cover with lid and simmer for 2-3 minutes to reheat the chicken and mushrooms</li>
    </ol>
    <ol> <h4>To serve:</h4>
        <li>Serve with vegetables, rice or over pasta.</li>
    </ol>
